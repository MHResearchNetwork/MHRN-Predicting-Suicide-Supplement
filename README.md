# MHRN-Predicting-Suicide-Supplement

Prediction and prevention of suicidal behavior is an urgent priority for healthcare systems and practicing clinicians. Existing evidence does not offer useful rules to guide clinicians’ or health systems’ practical decisions regarding risk assessment and follow-up care.  This study will use population-based data from seven large health systems that are part of the Mental Health Research Network (MHRN) to develop evidence-based suicide attempt risk calculators to help guide mental health and primary care clinicians.
